# End-to-End Machine Learning with Azure ML

This repository demonstrates a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) — from data ingestion and model training to deployment and real-time inference using managed online endpoints.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

- Azure ML workspace setup
- Data assets and datastores
- Training a machine learning model using Azure ML jobs
- Environment management with Conda and Azure ML environments
- Model registration and versioning
- Deployment using **Managed Online Endpoints**
- Real-time inference via REST API (`score.py`)

---

## 🧠 Use Case

A supervised machine learning classification task (e.g., Titanic survival prediction) is used to demonstrate:

- Training on structured tabular data
- Registering a trained model
- Deploying the model as a real-time REST API
- Sending inference requests to the deployed endpoint
